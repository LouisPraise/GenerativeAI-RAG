# 🎓 Andrew Ng AI Tutor (Work in Progress 🚧)

## 📌 About the Project
I am currently **developing** a Generative AI and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to help me in my Machine Learning and Data Science journey.

### The Problem
Every day, I watch video courses from the **Andrew Ng Machine Learning Specialization**. I copy the transcriptions and take screenshots of the slides to create PDF files for revision. 
Because I am now at the end of the specialization, I have **too many PDF files**. When I'm working on a project, it is very difficult to find exactly which file contains the answer I need.

### The Solution
I decided to build this GenAI tool as my second end-to-end project. It uses **RAG** to quickly find answers to my questions directly from Andrew Ng's video transcriptions. Instead of opening 50 PDFs, I just ask the AI.

## 🛠️ Tools I am using
*   **LlamaIndex**: To manage and connect my data.
*   **Groq**: For fast AI responses (used for educational purposes).
*   **HuggingFaceEmbeddings**: To help the AI understand the meaning of my notes.
*   **Python**: The core language of the project.

## 🚀 Current Status
- [x] Create the PDF database from course notes.
- [/] Building the RAG pipeline with LlamaIndex.
- [ ] Creating a simple user interface.
